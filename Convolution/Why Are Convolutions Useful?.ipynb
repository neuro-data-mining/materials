    "\n",
    "We can make our convolutions more complicated if we allow some kind of non-convolutional transformation afterwards (for mathletes -- a *non-linear* transformation). One example might be the transformation between the total input to a neuron to its firing rate. A very simple model would say that when input is below a threshold value, firing rate is 0, and then firing rate rises linearly as input increases above that value (this is the response function of a [leaky integrator neuron](http://charlesfrye.github.io/FoundationalNeuroscience/25/)). The graph (which appears below) looks a bit like a hockey stick.\n",
